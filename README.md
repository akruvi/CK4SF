# CK4SF: Rich Text Editor for Salesforce using CKEditor 5

It's a lightning component you can embed on any record page to create a rich-text editor for any text field.

## Requirements

This component only works under Lightning Web Security. If you are not using LWS, you can enable it in Setup -> Session Settings.

## About

CK4SF was created by Amnon Kruvi. Check out my other work:
